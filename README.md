# Assignment1
A continuation of the assignment we began after the first class.   As you begin using R more, teamwork, production values, internal documentation, and reproducibility will emerge as essential factors affecting the success of your projects. Learning to use the tools that support these success factors is an important part of learning R. In this exercise, you begin with the work that you did in the project where you used the esquisse package to plot some relationships in the mtcars data set.  

Deliverable

    Use car_viz.R as the starting point for a two documents.
        - html
        - pdf

    The text of the document should describe the data and discuss what you have learned in this very simple exploration.

    The commentary should address the code itself, noting features that may be important to anyone maintaining or using the it.

    Turn in your assignment by submitting a link to your github repo on blackboard. Make sure that the code in your repo will run to produce the documents your submit. While you might not always choose to push both the source code for a document and the document itself to your github, please do for this assignment.
